     * delivered as soon as they arrive, but are delivered after a short delay (called a "packet
     * buffer timeout"), more than one packet can be accumulated before the packets are delivered,
     * so that a single wakeup would be done for multiple packets, and each set of calls made to the
     * operating system would supply multiple packets, rather than a single packet. This reduces the
     * per-packet CPU overhead if packets are arriving at a high rate, increasing the number of
     * packets per second that can be captured. The packet buffer timeout is required so that an
     * application won't wait for the operating system's capture buffer to fill up before packets
     * are delivered; if packets are arriving slowly, that wait could take an arbitrarily long
     * period of time. Not all platforms support a packet buffer timeout; on platforms that don't,
     * the packet buffer timeout is ignored. A zero value for the timeout, on platforms that support
     * a packet buffer timeout, will cause a read to wait forever to allow enough packets to arrive,
     * with no timeout. A negative value is invalid; the result of setting the timeout to a negative
     * value is unpredictable. NOTE: the packet buffer timeout cannot be used to cause calls that
     * read packets to return within a limited period of time, because, on some platforms, the
     * packet buffer timeout isn't supported, and, on other platforms, the timer doesn't start until
     * at least one packet arrives. This means that the packet buffer timeout should NOT be used,
     * for example, in an interactive application to allow the packet capture loop to "poll" for
     * user input periodically, as there's no guarantee that a call reading packets will return
     * after the timeout expires even if no packets have arrived.
